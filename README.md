# neural_network_project
A WIP to have a web app using Python and JavaScript where the user can interact with a neural network using different inputs, outputs, weights, activation functions and backpropagation methods.

## Setup
Clone the repo, and once you got all the required dependencies (numpy, flask, matplotlib), run app.py from your IDE, go to localhost:4995 in your browser and enter the values as the placeholders present on the page. Once the form is sent, the page will get an image with the result data from the neural network. Fell free to test the app.
